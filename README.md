# 4212  -  Memorable 42-bit-12-character passphrases

A webpage to instantly generate memorable 42-bit passphrases.

Each of the 1530 possible words has a different 3-character prefix, allowing the passphrase to be
uniquely written as a 12-character password.

For example, if your passphrase is `lorem ipsum dolor sit`, you'd use the password `loripsdolsit`.
The longer phrase only serves as a mnemonic for the shortened version.

# Usage

A live version of `index.html` is hosted at
[kovaxis.github.com/4212](https://kovaxis.github.io/4212).
Just visit the page and get your passwords!

`index.html` is a self-contained 16KB file which you can download and open using any browser (IE11
or newer).
If you want to apply a healthy dose of paranoia you can also download and host the file yourself.
